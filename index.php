<p>One of the biggest successes of dConstruct 2007 this year were the pre-event workshops. These workshops were small, intimate affairs, so were heavily oversubscribed and sold out quickly. As well as assuring people a place at the conference itself, the workshops provided a great opportunity for people to get the most value from our great line-up of speakers. The workshops were also an excellent way of meeting people and networking before the main event. In fact, one of the most common bits of feedback we got from dConstruct were people expressing an interest in attending the workshops next year.</p>

<p>The sessions themselves were both enlightening and extremely practical. They ranged from theoretical discussions around the <a href="http://2007.dconstruct.org/workshops/#thomas">benefits and implementation of tagging systems</a>, through to hands-on workshops on the <a href="http://2007.dconstruct.org/workshops/#leisa">creativity</a> and <a href="http://2007.dconstruct.org/workshops/#peter">principles</a> of user experience design, replete with group exercises and lots and lots of sticky notes. The feedback was universally positive and everybody we spoke to had a great time.</p>

<p>These sessions were always intended to be one off events, closely tied to the main conference. However we&#8217;ve already had a number of people asking if we can run some of these sessions again. So rather than disappoint people, we thought we&#8217;d ask your opinion. Drop us an <a href="mailto:info@clearleft.com">email</a> if you&#8217;d like us to run one of the workshops again, at the start of December. If we get 10 or more people interested in a particular workshop, we&#8217;ll try to arrange a re-run. </p>

		<p>So that&#8217;s dConstruct over for another year. Thank you all for coming &ndash; it was a great day. Thanks too, for the fantastic feedback which has been overwhelmingly positive, while giving us plenty of good ideas for improving next year.</p>
		
		<p>Congratulations must go to our <a href="/speakers/">speakers</a>, who did a fantastic job. Some were universally lauded, others polarised opinion, which was great to see as there&#8217;s nothing like a bit of controversy to seed conversation. We&#8217;ll be adding links to their <a href="/schedule/">presentations</a> as they become available, and we&#8217;ll be releasing each session as a <a href="/podcast/">podcast</a> over the coming weeks.</p>
		
		<p>To follow the reaction to dConstruct, check out the <a href="http://dconstruct07.backnetwork.com/feeds/">blog posts</a> collated on the <a href="http://dconstruct07.backnetwork.com/">Backnetwork</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=dconstruct07">photos</a> in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/423467@N23/pool/">Flickr pool</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Speaking of photos, remember to upload your scavenger hunt photos to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/439140@N25/">dConstruct07 Scavenger Hunt Group</a> to stand a (good) chance of winning a ticket to <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/">SXSWi 2008</a> or one of two <a href="http://www.flickr.com/upgrade/">Flickr Pro</a> accounts. All submissions must be in by end of Friday 14th September.</p>
		
		<p>For the ultimate dConstruct souvenir we also have a few <a href="/tshirts/">t-shirts</a> left for sale. These were exclusively designed by <a href="http://bearskinrug.co.uk">Kevin Cornell</a> and are available for shipping worldwide.</p>
		
		<p>Well we had a fantastic time at dConstruct and hope you did too. Once more we&#8217;d like to thank all the speakers, sponsors and volunteers for making the conference possible. </p>

		<p>We look forward to seeing you at <a href="http://2008.dconstruct.org/">dConstruct 2008</a>.</p>
