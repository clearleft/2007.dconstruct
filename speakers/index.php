<p class="floatfix">If you&#8217;ve ever seen Jared speak about usability, you know that he&#8217;s probably the most effective, knowledgeable communicator on the subject today. What you probably don&#8217;t know is that he has guided the research agenda and built User Interface Engineering into the largest research organization of its kind in the world. He&#8217;s been working in the field of usability and design since 1978, before the term &#8216;usability&#8217; was ever associated with computers.</p>

<p>Jared spends his time working with the research teams at the company; he helps clients understand how to solve their design problems, and explains to reporters and industry analysts what the current state of design is all about. Jared is a top-rated speaker, and presents at over 20 conferences every year, and is the conference chair and keynote speaker at the annual User Interface Conference. Jared is on the faculty of the Tufts University Gordon Institute, and even manages to squeeze in a fair amount of writing time.</p>

<p class="vevent"><strong>Jared is presenting <em><a class="summary" href="/schedule/#jared">The Dawning of the Age of Experience</a></em>, <abbr class="dtstart" title="2007-09-07T10:00">10:00</abbr>&ndash;<abbr class="dtend" title="2007-09-07T10:45">10:45</abbr></strong></p>
